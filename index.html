	      <Strong>Who is Max Salk?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
	 I’ll never forget the time my dad and I drove to see Eric Clapton and Robert Cray in the Quad Cities on the evening of my first day of my sophomore year of high school. As soon as school was out – I was 15 at the time – he was waiting for me & we hit the road. What a show. I had never listened to Robert Cray before, but began a big fan thereafter. And Clapton of course was electric. We finally got back home around 2 a.m. and I got up at 6:30 the next day to go to school.
      </p>
      <p>
	That experience with my dad meant a lot to me, and is emblematic of the close relationship I have with my family. My parents have played a big part in formulating my values and principles, such as hard work, honesty, and integrity. They also taught me to enjoy life as it comes along.
      </p>
      <p>
	In my free time, I enjoy working out, hanging out with friends, and catching re-runs of South Park and The Simpsons.
