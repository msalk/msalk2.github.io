    <section id="about">
      <p> 
      My name is Max Salk. Before moving to New York in summer 2015, I worked as an investment analyst for PPM America in Chicago. I began my career with Morningstar, where I worked for 10 months after graduating from college. I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and graduated with a Finance degree and History minor.
      </p>
      <p>
      My interest in and passion for the financial markets began late in college, watching CNBC and researching/trading stocks. My interest in the markets expanded greatly during my tenure at PPM, where I first had the opportunity to closely follow companies, and research and recommend investment ideas for a living.
      </p>
      <p> My interests are varied. I’ve always had a passion for history, and tend to leverage an historical framework when analyzing the market and making investment decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
      I love music. Bob Dylan, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, and a variety of old-time blues and folk musicians have had a significant influence on my life/tastes over the past decade and change.
      </p>
      <p>
      With respect to sports, it is the Bears and the Cubs for me. Personally, I enjoy playing football, and lately bowling.
      </p>
      <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy working out, hanging out with friends, and catching re-runs of South Park and The Simpsons. I’ve recently gotten involved with the <a href='https://www.navysealfoundation.org/'>Navy SEAL Foundation</a>, which raises money to support Navy SEALs and their families through a variety of support programs. I am looking to get more involved in volunteer work to assist both active duty military and veterans.
